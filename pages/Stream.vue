          Online gaming started for me in 1996 with Warcraft II as a trash
          talking eight year old. From there I discovered MMOs in 1997, most
          notably sandbox MMOs such as Ultima Online and Darkfall. My current
          favorite MMO is Black Desert, which is the primary focus of the
          stream, though I also stream a variety of single player RPGs. You can
          see more about the games I play down below under the Schedule tab.
